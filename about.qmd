I study disease ecology in Meggan Craft's lab at the University of Minnesota. Particularly, I am interested in the spatial dynamics of disease transmission and multi-host, environmental macroparasites. In the field, I collect ticks (I'm doing just that in the photo to the left!), and in the office I think about ways to model parasite clustering and its influence on host populations. I also love to design apps and games to use for ecology education and outreach! When I'm not doing any of those things, I might be goofing around on my guitar 🎸, going for a jog 🏃🏼, or playing some retro videogames 🎮.
